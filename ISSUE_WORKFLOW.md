# Issue Workflow

This document outlines the workflow for reporting, triaging, and resolving issues within Inflectivex repositories.

## Issue Types

- **Bug Report** – Unexpected behavior or defects.  
- **Feature Request** – New functionality or enhancements.  
- **Documentation** – Updates or corrections to project documentation.  
- **Discussion** – Questions or design-related conversations.

## Reporting Issues

When creating a new issue, include:

- A clear title  
- Detailed description  
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)  
- Expected behavior  
- Actual behavior  
- Environment details (version, platform, configuration)

## Triaging

Maintainers will:

1. Review new issues  
2. Assign labels (bug, enhancement, documentation, etc.)  
3. Request additional information if needed  
4. Prioritize the issue based on project roadmap  

## Resolution

- Issues may be assigned to contributors or maintainers.  
- Related pull requests must reference the issue ID.  
- Issues are closed only when the associated fix or feature is merged into the repository.
